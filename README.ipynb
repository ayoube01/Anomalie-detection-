    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "Those notebooks are mainly about performing statistical anomaly detection against software performance indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several complimentary strategies exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://blog.statsbot.co/time-series-anomaly-detection-algorithms-1cef5519aef2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier detection can be used to flag strong spikes and dips in a time series as anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "- our time series have a **normal distribution**\n",
    "- **every outlier is a genuine anomaly** and not an error, given that our indicators come from software and not a human sensus\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, we consider short-lived outliers (small spikes) as a normal behaviour that can have several low-level origins:\n",
    "- garbage collection\n",
    "- small contentions (network, disk ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want to consider those as genuine incidents (at least if they're isolated).\n",
    "Thus, we want to consider as **incidents** anomalies that occur for a **relatively extended** period of time (say more than 10s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, most outlier detection techniques assume that the time series are relatively flat.\n",
    "In case of seasonal data with strong variance across a period, we have to **wisely choose a window** that would reduce this variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation: Atlas\n",
    "\n",
    "eBay described their version of this with the Atlas method. Please see [Atlas.ipynb](./Atlas.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our time series are seasonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, to increase accuracy we can extract the seasonal component of the time series, giving us a flat time series on which we can do classical outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [Atlas.ipynb](./Atlas.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Literature\n",

    "### Dieter Plaetinck's method\n",
    "\n",
    "Dieter Plaetinck describbed a method for performin anomaly detection based on the comparison of the distribution of historical values, over a wide window of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is interesting as it calculates some derived indicators that we could feed to ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [Dieterbe method.ipynb](./wip/Dieterbe method.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ayoube's experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of this method is to compare current value to distribution of historical values at the same exact timestamp, assuming that the data as a weekly seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see [calcul_indice.ipynb](./wip/calcul_indice.ipynb)\n",
